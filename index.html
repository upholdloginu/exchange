<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Overview And Reputation</h2>
<div class="content" style="text-align: justify;">

Uphold is a popular US cryptocurrency <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Uphold exchange</strong></span> headquartered in New York. It was created by CNET founder, Halsey Minor, in 2014. It has processed over $4 billion transactions since its founding.

Uphold is regulated by the US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and is a licensed money transmitter in all states and countries where it operates, except in cases where a license is not required. Licenses for US states can be found here.

In the crypto community, Uphold is most known for two things:
<ol>
 	<li>Its partnership with Brave Browser, allowing it to be chosen as a place for Brave users to receive deposits of their BAT rewards</li>
 	<li>The fact that it allows users to swap crypto for not only fiat, but also for equities and precious metals</li>
</ol>
Uphold is also well-known as a transparent cryptocurrency Uphold  exchange. It publishes a real-time audit of its assets and liabilities.

<h2>Trading Fees</h2>
<div class="content">

For cryptocurrency purchases or sales, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><a href="https://upholdloginu.github.io/exchange/">Uphold exchange</a></strong></span> charges a spread on each transaction, and this spread varies depending on the particular asset being purchased or sold.

The spread on major cryptocurrencies such as BTC and ETH is usually 0.8 to 1.2% in the US and Europe. Outside of these core areas, the spread for these major cryptos can rise as high as 1.8%. Low liquidity, low market-cap coins generally have the widest spreads, regardless of area.

For conversions from one major fiat currency to another, Uphold charges approximately 0.2% per transaction. These major currencies include USD, EUR, and GBP.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Uphold exchange</strong></span> charges around 3% spread per trade for precious metals, and approximately 1% per trade for equities.

The size of Uphold’s spread varies based on the particular asset being traded and current market conditions. So we can’t show you an up to date chart on it. However, there is a current Uphold official list of spreads for users that are interested.
<h3>Price Protection Fee for business accounts</h3>
Uphold allows business owners to open special accounts that can be used to make free cross-border payments to remote workers, suppliers, etc. But these accounts do have additional fees that are not charged to personal accounts.

As far as trading fees are concerned, the only additional one for business accounts is the <strong>Price Protection Fee</strong>. This is an approx. 0.75% additional charge for currency conversion. This fee is intended to guarantee that the business obtains exactly the amount of currency it needs, which may be important if the business intends to use this currency to make a payment.

Business accounts are also subject to additional deposit and withdrawal fees, which we’ll discuss in the relevant sections below.
<h3>No additional trading fees</h3>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><a href="https://upholdloginu.github.io/exchange/">Uphold exchange</a></strong></span> does not charge any additional <em>trading</em> fees beyond those listed here. For example, it does not charge a commission.
